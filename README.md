# Gravity-Current-Data-Simulation
This repo contains the data script files that are used in 'Entrainment and Mixing of Gravity Currents in a Stratified Ambient'- A. Ooi et al. 2021.

This repo consist of scripts for:
* [Kinetic Energy Calculation using Delaunay Triangulation](integralDelaunayFullRun.ipynb) and [Instructions](integralDelaunayImplementation.ipynb)
* [Retrieving temperature at different heights](xTempPlot.ipynb)
* [3D to 2D mesh conversion](gausslobattoModified.ipynb)
